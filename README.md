# invitation-mail
This program helps us to generate invitation letters for our friends without having to write same letter individually to our friends. 

User can enter the names of guests to be invited in a text file.

The user can then write the letter to be sent to all these guests.

Wherever in the letter the keyword "[name]" will appear, the code would replace it with the names of guests one by one and generate the separate letters for all the guests.
